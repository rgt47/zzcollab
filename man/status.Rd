\description{
This function checks for running Docker containers that have the 'zzcollab' label.
It's useful for monitoring your development environment and seeing which containers
are currently active for your research projects.
}
\details{
The function uses Docker's filtering capabilities to find containers with the
'zzcollab' label. This label is automatically added to containers created by
the zzcollab framework.
}

\dontrun{
# Check if any zzcollab containers are running

} else {
  cat("No zzcollab containers currently running\n")
