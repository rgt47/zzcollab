# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates the recommended workflow for scholarly manuscript development using ZZCOLLAB, following the unified research compendium framework [@marwick2018] and best practices for reproducible computational manuscripts [@gentleman2007; @knuth1984].

**Key Philosophy**: Use the **same structure** for manuscript writing as data analysis. No separate "manuscript paradigm"—simply add `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` when ready to write [@marwick2018].

## What You Will Learn

- Writing reproducible manuscripts with R Markdown [@xie2018]
- Integrating analysis code with narrative text [@knuth1984]
- Managing bibliographies and citations [@xie2018]
- Rendering to multiple output formats (PDF, Word, HTML)
- Collaborating on manuscripts with version control [@ram2013]
- Automating manuscript builds with CI/CD

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- ZZCOLLAB installed (`./install.sh`)
- Completed analysis (see "Data Analysis" vignette)
- LaTeX distribution (for PDF output) or Quarto (recommended)
- Git configured with credentials

# The Unified Compendium Approach to Manuscripts

## There Is No "Manuscript Paradigm"

Traditional approach: Create separate "manuscript project" from "analysis project."

**ZZCOLLAB approach** [@marwick2018; @gentleman2007]: **Same project, just add paper.Rmd**.

```
Week 1 (Analysis Only):      Week 4 (Add Manuscript):        Month 2 (Publish):
analysis/                    analysis/                       analysis/
├── data/                   ├── data/                       ├── data/
├── scripts/                ├── scripts/                    ├── scripts/
└── figures/                ├── figures/                    ├── figures/
                            └── paper/                      └── paper/
                                ├── paper.Rmd (ADD!)            ├── paper.Rmd
                                └── references.bib              ├── paper.pdf
                                                                └── supplementary.pdf
R/                          R/                              R/
└── functions.R             └── functions.R                 └── functions.R
                                                            tests/
                                                            └── testthat/
```

**No migration needed**—manuscript sources analysis from same project [@marwick2018].

## When to Write as You Go vs. After Analysis

Two valid approaches [@marwick2018]:

### Approach 1: Analysis First, Manuscript Later
**Best for**: Exploratory research, novel methods, uncertain direction

1. **Week 1-8**: Analyze data, develop methods, create functions
2. **Week 9+**: Add `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` to write up results

**Advantage**: Clear understanding of findings before writing.

### Approach 2: Write as You Go (Literate Programming)
**Best for**: Hypothesis-driven research, established methods [@knuth1984]

1. **Day 1**: Create `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` with introduction
2. **Daily**: Add analysis code + narrative as you work
3. **Final week**: Polish, render final document

**Advantage**: Writing and analysis develop together.

**ZZCOLLAB supports both** - use the same structure [@marwick2018].

# Step-by-Step: Manuscript Development Workflow

## Step 1: Project Initialization (Same as Analysis!)

The manuscript workflow starts **identically** to data analysis [@marwick2018].

### Configure ZZCOLLAB

```bash
# One-time configuration
zzcollab --config init
zzcollab --config set team-name "myusername"
zzcollab --config set github-account "myusername"
zzcollab --config set profile-name "ubuntu_standard_publishing"  # Publishing profile includes LaTeX + Quarto
```

### Create Research Project

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir penguin-morphology-paper && cd penguin-morphology-paper

# Initialize ZZCOLLAB project (identical to analysis workflow)
zzcollab

# Build Docker environment with publishing tools
make docker-build
```

**What this creates** - **Identical to analysis workflow**:

```
penguin-morphology-paper/
├── analysis/
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── raw_data/              # Research data
│   │   └── derived_data/          # Processed data
│   ├── figures/                   # Figures for paper
│   ├── scripts/                   # Analysis code
│   └── paper/                     # Manuscript (initially empty - add when ready!)
├── R/                             # Reusable functions
├── tests/                         # Unit tests
├── DESCRIPTION                    # Project metadata
├── Dockerfile                     # Development environment
├── renv.lock                      # Package versions
└── Makefile                       # Convenient commands
```

**Key insight**: This is **exactly the same structure** as data analysis. The only difference is you'll add content to `analysis/paper/` [@marwick2018].

## Step 2: Develop Analysis (Standard Workflow)

Complete your analysis first using the standard data analysis workflow (see "Data Analysis" vignette).

### Analysis Pipeline Example

```bash
# Enter Docker container (starts R directly)
make r

# Inside R: Install packages
> install.packages("palmerpenguins")
> install.packages("tidyverse")
> install.packages("broom")
> q()

# Exiting R triggers auto-snapshot!
```

Create analysis scripts in `analysis/scripts/`:
- `01_prepare_data.R` - Data cleaning and preparation
- `02_exploratory_analysis.R` - EDA and visualization
- `03_statistical_models.R` - Hypothesis testing and modeling
- `04_generate_figures.R` - Publication-quality figures

Run complete analysis:

```bash
make docker-sh

Rscript analysis/scripts/01_prepare_data.R
Rscript analysis/scripts/02_exploratory_analysis.R
Rscript analysis/scripts/03_statistical_models.R
Rscript analysis/scripts/04_generate_figures.R

exit
```

**Tip**: Use `make r` if you prefer to work directly in R. Use `make docker-sh` for shell access when running batch scripts.

## Step 3: Create Manuscript Structure

When analysis is complete (or as you go), add manuscript structure.

### Create paper.Rmd

Create `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd`:

  **Background**: Allometric scaling relationships between body size and morphological
  traits provide fundamental insights into ecological and evolutionary processes.
  However, comparative studies across closely related penguin species are limited.

  **Methods**: We analyzed morphological measurements from 342 adult penguins of three
  species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) collected at Palmer Station, Antarctica (2007-2009).
  We fit linear mixed-effects models to quantify scaling relationships between bill
  dimensions and body mass, controlling for species and sex.

  **Results**: Bill length scaled isometrically with body mass (slope = 1.02, 95% CI:
  0.98-1.06), while bill depth showed negative allometry (slope = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.74-0.82).
  Species-specific slopes differed significantly (χ² = 24.3, df = 2, p < 0.001), with
  Gentoo penguins showing the steepest scaling relationships.

  **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest differential selection pressures on bill dimensions
  across penguin species, likely related to foraging ecology and prey specialization. The
  negative allometry of bill depth may reflect biomechanical constraints on feeding
  efficiency.

# Introduction

Allometric scaling—the relationship between morphological traits and body size—is a
fundamental principle in ecology and evolution [@schmidt-nielsen_scaling_1984].
Understanding how specific traits scale with overall body size provides insights into
biomechanical constraints, physiological demands, and ecological specialization
[@west_general_1997].

In seabirds, bill morphology is particularly important for foraging ecology, as bill
dimensions directly influence prey capture efficiency, handling time, and dietary niche
[@grant_evolution_2002]. Penguins exhibit remarkable morphological diversity despite their
recent evolutionary radiation [@clarke_scaling_2006], making them ideal subjects for
comparative allometric studies.

The Palmer Penguins dataset [@horst_palmer_2020] provides detailed morphological
measurements from three sympatric species: Adelie (*Pygoscelis adeliae*), Chinstrap
(*P. antarcticus*), and Gentoo (*P. papua*) penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica. These
species exhibit substantial body size variation (2700-6300 g) and occupy distinct ecological
niches [@gorman_ecological_2014], enabling robust comparative analyses of allometric
scaling patterns.

Here, we quantify scaling relationships between bill dimensions (length and depth) and
body mass across species and sexes, testing the hypothesis that bill morphology shows
differential allometry related to foraging specialization.

# Methods

## Study System and Data Collection

We analyzed morphological data from 342 adult penguins collected during the breeding
seasons of 2007-2009 at Palmer Station, Antarctica (64.77°S, 64.05°W) [@gorman_ecological_2014].
Data include bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), and body mass (g) for three species, with
individuals sexed through molecular methods [@horst_palmer_2020].

```{r data-preparation}
# Load and prepare data
penguins <- prepare_penguin_data(palmerpenguins::penguins)

# Summary statistics
n_total <- nrow(penguins)
n_by_species <- table(penguins$species)
```

Our final dataset included ` r n_total` penguins: ` r n_by_species["Adelie"]` Adelie,
` r n_by_species["Chinstrap"]` Chinstrap, and ` r n_by_species["Gentoo"]` Gentoo individuals.

## Statistical Analysis

We fit linear mixed-effects models to quantify allometric scaling relationships:

$$\log(Y) = \alpha + \beta \log(M) + \gamma S + \delta(S \times \log(M)) + \epsilon$$

where $Y$ is the morphological trait (bill length or depth), $M$ is body mass, $S$ is
species, and $\epsilon$ represents residual error. The slope $\beta$ indicates the scaling
exponent: $\beta = 1$ indicates isometry, $\beta < 1$ negative allometry, and $\beta > 1$
positive allometry [@schmidt-nielsen_scaling_1984].

```{r model-fitting}
# Fit scaling models
model_bill_length <- fit_body_mass_model(
  penguins,
  response = "bill_length_mm"
)

model_bill_depth <- fit_body_mass_model(
  penguins,
  response = "bill_depth_mm"
)

# Extract coefficients
coef_length <- tidy(model_bill_length, conf.int = TRUE)
coef_depth <- tidy(model_bill_depth, conf.int = TRUE)
```

All analyses were conducted in R version ` r getRversion()` [@r_core_team_r_2023] using
the tidyverse [@wickham_welcome_2019], broom [@robinson_broom_2021], and palmerpenguins
[@horst_palmer_2020] packages. Complete code and data are available at
https://github.com/yourusername/penguin-morphology-paper (reproducible research compendium
following @marwick2018).

# Results

## Allometric Scaling Patterns

Bill length showed near-isometric scaling with body mass (slope = ` r round(coef_length$estimate[2], 2)`,
95% CI: ` r round(coef_length$conf.low[2], 2)`-` r round(coef_length$conf.high[2], 2)`;
Fig. 1A). This indicates that bill length increases proportionally with body size across
species [@schmidt-nielsen_scaling_1984].

In contrast, bill depth exhibited negative allometry (slope = ` r round(coef_depth$estimate[2], 2)`,
95% CI: ` r round(coef_depth$conf.low[2], 2)`-` r round(coef_depth$conf.high[2], 2)`;
Fig. 1B), suggesting biomechanical constraints on bill depth relative to body mass
[@west_general_1997].

```{r figure-1, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Allometric scaling relationships between bill dimensions and body mass in Palmer Penguins. (A) Bill length shows isometric scaling. (B) Bill depth shows negative allometry. Points represent individual penguins colored by species. Lines show species-specific regression fits with 95% confidence intervals (shaded regions)."}

```

## Species-Specific Differences

Species-specific scaling slopes differed significantly for both bill dimensions (likelihood
ratio tests: bill length χ² = 24.3, df = 2, p < 0.001; bill depth χ² = 31.7, df = 2,
p < 0.001). Gentoo penguins showed the steepest scaling relationships, followed by
Chinstrap and Adelie species (Table 1).

```{r table-1}
# Create summary table of model results
results_table <- data.frame(
  Trait = c("Bill Length", "Bill Length", "Bill Length",
            "Bill Depth", "Bill Depth", "Bill Depth"),
  Species = rep(c("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"), 2),
  Slope = c(0.98, 1.03, 1.08, 0.72, 0.78, 0.84),
  CI_Lower = c(0.93, 0.97, 1.02, 0.67, 0.72, 0.78),
  CI_Upper = c(1.03, 1.09, 1.14, 0.77, 0.84, 0.90),
  P_Value = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001)
)

kable(results_table,
      caption = "Species-specific allometric scaling slopes for bill dimensions",
      col.names = c("Trait", "Species", "Slope", "95% CI Lower", "95% CI Upper", "P-value"),
      digits = 2,
      align = "lccccc") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  pack_rows("Bill Length", 1, 3) %>%
  pack_rows("Bill Depth", 4, 6)
```

# Discussion

Our analysis reveals distinct allometric scaling patterns for bill dimensions in Palmer
Penguins, with important implications for understanding foraging ecology and morphological
evolution in this group.

## Isometric Scaling of Bill Length

The near-isometric scaling of bill length (slope ≈ 1.0) suggests that this trait maintains
geometric similarity across body sizes [@schmidt-nielsen_scaling_1984]. This pattern is
consistent with previous studies of seabird bill morphology [@grant_evolution_2002] and
may reflect selective pressure to maintain optimal prey capture efficiency across the body
size range observed in these species.

## Negative Allometry of Bill Depth

In contrast, bill depth shows negative allometry (slope < 1.0), indicating that larger
penguins have proportionally shallower bills than smaller individuals. This pattern may
arise from biomechanical constraints on bite force and gape limitation [@herrel_evolution_2005],
as excessively deep bills could compromise feeding efficiency despite increasing body size.

## Ecological Implications

The species-specific differences in scaling slopes (Table 1) likely reflect dietary
specialization and foraging niche partitioning among sympatric penguins [@gorman_ecological_2014].
Gentoo penguins, which feed primarily on fish, show steeper scaling relationships than
Adelie and Chinstrap penguins, which consume more krill. This pattern suggests that bill
morphology has evolved differentially in response to prey type and foraging mode
[@grant_evolution_2002].

## Study Limitations

Our analysis is cross-sectional and therefore cannot distinguish ontogenetic allometry from
evolutionary allometry [@klingenberg_ontogeny_1998]. Future longitudinal studies tracking
individual growth trajectories would provide stronger inference about developmental
mechanisms underlying these scaling patterns.

# Conclusions

Bill morphology in Palmer Penguins exhibits complex allometric scaling patterns that vary
by species and trait. The contrasting allometry of bill length (isometric) versus bill
depth (negative) suggests differential selective pressures and biomechanical constraints
on feeding apparatus evolution. These findings contribute to broader understanding of
morphological diversification in recently radiated seabird groups and highlight the value
of allometric analysis for revealing ecological and evolutionary processes.

### Download Citation Style

```bash
make docker-sh

# Download citation style (Ecology Letters example)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/ecology-letters.csl \
  -O analysis/paper/ecology-letters.csl

exit
```

## Step 4: Render Manuscript

### Render to PDF (LaTeX)

```bash
make docker-sh

R
> rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")
> quit()

exit
```

Output: `analysis/paper/paper.pdf`

### Render to Word

Useful for collaborators who prefer Microsoft Word:

```bash
make docker-sh

R
> rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd", output_format = "word_document")
> quit()

exit
```

Output: `analysis/paper/paper.docx`

### Render to HTML

Great for web sharing and interactive code:

```bash
make docker-sh

R
> rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd", output_format = "html_document")
> quit()

exit
```

Output: `analysis/paper/paper.html`

### Render to All Formats

```bash
make docker-sh

R
> rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd", output_format = "all")
> quit()

exit
```

## Step 5: Create Supplementary Materials

Many journals require supplementary materials [@marwick2018].

### Create supplementary.Rmd

Create `analysis/paper/supplementary.Rmd`:

````markdown
---
title: "Supporting Information: Allometric Scaling in Palmer Penguins"
output:
  pdf_document:
    number_sections: true
  html_document:
    toc: true
---

```{r supplementary-setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# Supplementary Methods

## Data Quality Control

# Residual plots, Q-Q plots, influence diagnostics
```

# Supplementary Results

## Additional Analyses

### Sexual Dimorphism

```{r sexual-dimorphism}
# Analysis of sex-specific allometry
```

### Temporal Trends

```{r temporal-analysis}
# Year effects on scaling relationships
```

```{r table-s1}
# Full model output with all coefficients
```

## Table S2: Sensitivity Analysis

```{r table-s2}
# Results under alternative model specifications
```
````

## Step 6: Automated Manuscript Rendering

Automate rendering with Makefile and CI/CD [@marwick2018].

### Add Makefile Targets

Add to `Makefile`:

```makefile
# Manuscript rendering targets
.PHONY: manuscript manuscript-pdf manuscript-word manuscript-html manuscript-all

manuscript: manuscript-all

manuscript-pdf:
	@echo "Rendering manuscript to PDF..."
	docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/project" -w /project $(DOCKER_IMAGE) \
		Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis/paper/paper.Rmd', output_format = 'pdf_document')"

manuscript-word:
	@echo "Rendering manuscript to Word..."
	docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/project" -w /project $(DOCKER_IMAGE) \
		Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis/paper/paper.Rmd', output_format = 'word_document')"

manuscript-html:
	@echo "Rendering manuscript to HTML..."
	docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/project" -w /project $(DOCKER_IMAGE) \
		Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis/paper/paper.Rmd', output_format = 'html_document')"

manuscript-all: manuscript-pdf manuscript-word manuscript-html supplementary
	@echo "All manuscript formats rendered successfully"

supplementary:
	@echo "Rendering supplementary materials..."
	docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/project" -w /project $(DOCKER_IMAGE) \
		Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis/paper/supplementary.Rmd', output_format = 'all')"
```

### Usage

```bash
# Render manuscript to all formats
make manuscript

# Or specific formats
make manuscript-pdf
make manuscript-word
make manuscript-html
```

## Step 7: Version Control and Collaboration

Manuscripts benefit enormously from version control [@ram2013; @bryan2018].

### Commit Manuscript Source

```bash
# Add manuscript files
git add analysis/paper/paper.Rmd
git add analysis/paper/supplementary.Rmd
git add analysis/paper/references.bib
git add analysis/paper/*.csl

# Commit
git commit -m "Add manuscript draft

- Allometric scaling analysis of Palmer Penguins
- Methods, results, discussion sections complete
- Supplementary materials included
- Citation style: Ecology Letters"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Collaborative Writing with GitHub

**Approach 1: Branch-Based Workflow**

```bash
# Co-author creates branch
git checkout -b coauthor-edits

# Make changes to paper.Rmd
# ...

# Commit changes
git add analysis/paper/paper.Rmd
git commit -m "Revise introduction and discussion"

gh pr create --title "Manuscript revisions" --body "Updated intro/discussion based on reviewer feedback"
```

**Approach 2: Direct Collaboration**

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Edit manuscript
# ...

# Commit with descriptive message
git add analysis/paper/paper.Rmd
git commit -m "Add sensitivity analysis section

- Test robustness to outlier removal
- Alternative model specifications
- Results unchanged (robustness confirmed)"

git push
```

### Track Manuscript Versions

Use git tags for submission milestones:

```bash
# Tag initial submission
git tag -a v1.0-submission -m "Initial submission to Ecology Letters"
git push origin v1.0-submission

# Tag revision
git tag -a v1.1-revision1 -m "First revision addressing reviewer comments"
git push origin v1.1-revision1

# Tag final acceptance
git tag -a v1.2-accepted -m "Accepted manuscript"
git push origin v1.2-accepted
```

## Step 8: Continuous Integration for Manuscripts

Automate manuscript rendering on every commit using CI/CD [@marwick2018].

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/render-manuscript.yml`:

```yaml
name: Render Manuscript

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
    paths:
      - 'analysis/paper/**'
      - 'analysis/scripts/**'
      - 'analysis/data/**'
      - 'R/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  render-manuscript:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: 'release'

      - name: Install system dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y \
            texlive-latex-base \
            texlive-latex-extra \
            texlive-fonts-recommended \
            texlive-fonts-extra \
            pandoc

      - name: Restore R packages from renv.lock
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2

      - name: Render manuscript to PDF
        run: |
          Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis/paper/paper.Rmd', output_format = 'pdf_document')"

      - name: Render supplementary materials
        run: |
          Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis/paper/supplementary.Rmd', output_format = 'pdf_document')"

      - name: Upload PDF artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: manuscript-pdf
          path: |
            analysis/paper/paper.pdf
            analysis/paper/supplementary.pdf

      - name: Render manuscript to Word
        run: |
          Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis/paper/paper.Rmd', output_format = 'word_document')"

      - name: Upload Word artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: manuscript-word
          path: analysis/paper/paper.docx
```

**Benefits**:
- Manuscript automatically builds on every push
- Catch rendering errors before submission
- Collaborators download latest rendered version
- Ensures reproducibility of manuscript from source

# Advanced Topics

## Journal-Specific Templates

Many journals provide R Markdown templates [@xie2018].

### Using rticles Package

```bash
make docker-sh

R
> install.packages("rticles")
>
> # List available templates
> rticles::journals()
>
> # Create journal-specific manuscript
> rmarkdown::draft(
>   "analysis/paper/plos_one.Rmd",
>   template = "plos_article",
>   package = "rticles"
> )

> quit()
exit
```

### Available Journal Templates

- **PLOS**: PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology
- **Elsevier**: Most Elsevier journals
- **Springer**: Most Springer journals
- **AGU**: American Geophysical Union journals
- **ASA**: American Statistical Association journals
- **Biometrics**: Biometrics, Biometrical Journal
- **Many more**: See `rticles::journals()`

## Quarto for Enhanced Publishing

Quarto (https://quarto.org) is the next-generation R Markdown [@xie2018].

### Install Quarto

```bash
# In publishing Docker profile, Quarto is pre-installed
make docker-sh

quarto --version

exit
```

### Create Quarto Manuscript

Create `analysis/paper/paper.qmd`:

````markdown
---
title: "Allometric Scaling in Palmer Penguins"
format:
  pdf:
    documentclass: article
    keep-tex: true
  html:
    code-fold: true
    toc: true
  docx: default
bibliography: references.bib
---

## Introduction

(Same content as paper.Rmd, but with enhanced features)

```{r}
#| label: fig-allometry
#| fig-cap: "Bill length vs body mass"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5
#| code-fold: true

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Allometric Scaling of Bill Length")
```
````

### Render Quarto Document

```bash
make docker-sh

quarto render analysis/paper/paper.qmd --to all

exit
```

**Advantages of Quarto**:
- Multiple output formats from one source
- Better code annotation (`#| label`, `#| fig-cap`)
- Cross-references and citations
- Advanced layouts and themes
- Dashboards and interactive outputs

## Preprints and Open Access

Share manuscripts before peer review [@marwick2018].

### Submit to bioRxiv/arXiv

1. Render manuscript to PDF
2. Upload to preprint server
3. Add DOI to repository README

```bash
# After preprint publication
echo "Preprint DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.123456" >> README.md
git commit -am "Add preprint DOI"
git push
```

### Link Code and Preprint

Add badge to README:

```markdown
[![bioRxiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/bioRxiv-10.1101%2F2024.01.15.123456-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.15.123456)
```

## Managing Large Figures

For manuscripts with many high-resolution figures:

### External Figure Repository

```bash
# Store figures in separate repository (if very large)
# Reference in manuscript via URL

# Or use Git LFS for large files
git lfs track "analysis/figures/*.pdf"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track large PDFs with Git LFS"
```

### Figure Caching

In `paper.Rmd`:

````markdown
```{r caching-setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, cache.path = "../cache/")
```
````

Figures are cached - only regenerate when code changes.

# Best Practices Summary

Following reproducible manuscript development best practices [@marwick2018; @gentleman2007; @knuth1984]:

## Manuscript Organization
✅ **Source in version control** - paper.Rmd tracked with git
✅ **Literate programming** - Code + narrative integrated [@knuth1984]
✅ **Reproducible from source** - `rmarkdown::render()` rebuilds manuscript
✅ **Multiple output formats** - PDF, Word, HTML from same source

## Citations and References
✅ **Bibliography in .bib format** - references.bib with all citations
✅ **Journal citation styles** - Downloaded .csl files
✅ **Automatic formatting** - pandoc-citeproc handles citations
✅ **CrossRef integration** - DOIs for all references

## Collaboration
✅ **Version control everything** - git tracks all manuscript changes
✅ **Meaningful commit messages** - "Add results section" not "Update"
✅ **Pull requests for revisions** - Review changes before merging
✅ **Tag submission versions** - v1.0-submission, v1.1-revision1

## Automation
✅ **Makefile targets** - `make manuscript` renders all formats
✅ **CI/CD integration** - GitHub Actions builds on every commit
✅ **Artifact uploads** - Latest PDF/Word always available
✅ **Reproducibility validation** - CI checks manuscript builds from scratch

## Data and Code
✅ **Computational reproducibility** - Same code + data → same results
✅ **Explicit dependencies** - renv.lock captures exact package versions
✅ **Analysis pipeline** - Numbered scripts show execution order
✅ **Tested functions** - Unit tests validate analytical correctness

# Progression From Analysis to Manuscript

## The Natural Workflow

Starting from analysis, manuscript writing is a natural extension [@marwick2018]:

### Week 1-4: Analysis Phase
```
my-project/
├── analysis/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── scripts/                # Complete analysis pipeline
│   └── figures/                # Publication figures generated
└── R/
    └── functions.R             # Reusable analysis functions
```

**No manuscript yet** - focus on getting analysis right.

### Week 5: Add Manuscript Structure
```
my-project/
├── analysis/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── scripts/
│   ├── figures/
│   └── paper/                  # ADD: Manuscript directory
│       ├── paper.Rmd           # ADD: Manuscript source
│       └── references.bib      # ADD: Bibliography
└── R/
    └── functions.R
```

**Start writing** - integrate analysis results into narrative.

### Week 6-8: Iterative Writing
```
# Daily workflow:
make docker-sh
# Edit paper.Rmd
# Update analysis if needed
exit  # Auto-snapshot!

# Render and review
make manuscript-pdf
```

**Manuscript develops alongside refinements to analysis** [@knuth1984].

### Week 9: Submission Prep
```
my-project/
├── analysis/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── scripts/
│   ├── figures/
│   └── paper/
│       ├── paper.Rmd
│       ├── paper.pdf          # Final manuscript
│       ├── supplementary.Rmd
│       ├── supplementary.pdf  # Supplementary materials
│       ├── references.bib
│       └── ecology-letters.csl
└── R/
    └── functions.R
```

**Ready for submission** - manuscript + supplementary + code repository.

## The Key: No Separation

At every stage, **analysis and manuscript live in the same project**. No copy-paste between "analysis project" and "manuscript project" [@marwick2018; @gentleman2007].

**Benefits**:
- Changes to analysis automatically update manuscript
- No version sync issues between code and text
- Complete reproducibility - manuscript rebuilds from data
- Natural progression from exploration to publication

## Publishing as Blog Post

Want to share your manuscript findings as a blog post? ZZCOLLAB projects integrate seamlessly with Quarto blogs:

```bash
# Run the blog setup script
modules/setup_symlinks.sh

# See vignette: "Blog Post Development with ZZCOLLAB"
```

Blog posts can complement formal publications by reaching broader audiences and providing accessible summaries of research findings.
