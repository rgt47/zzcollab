# Team R Interface for Collaborative Development

This vignette demonstrates ZZCOLLAB's team collaboration capabilities using R functions that abstract containerization technologies for multi-developer research teams. This approach enables teams with varied R expertise to collaborate effectively while maintaining reproducible computational environments.

## Team Collaboration Framework

The R interface provides collaborative reproducibility through familiar R functional patterns while handling Docker orchestration transparently. Teams can focus on research and analysis rather than infrastructure management.

### Key Team Features:

- **Role-Based Workflows**: Different team members use specialized R functions for their responsibilities
- **Shared Environments**: Identical computational environments across all team members
- **Transparent Coordination**: Automatic synchronization of packages, data, and configurations
- **Collaborative Integration**: Built-in support for code review, version control, and team communication

## Team Roles and R Interface Functions

### Role 1: Team Lead (Project Coordinator)
**Primary Functions**: `init_team_project()`, `manage_team_config()`, `coordinate_releases()`

### Role 2: Senior Developers (Core Contributors)
**Primary Functions**: `join_project()`, `create_branch()`, `review_contributions()`, `merge_changes()`

### Role 3: Data Scientists (Analysis Contributors)
**Primary Functions**: `join_project()`, `run_analysis()`, `sync_results()`, `create_reports()`

### Role 4: Junior Developers (Learning Contributors)
**Primary Functions**: `join_project()`, `learn_workflow()`, `contribute_tests()`, `seek_review()`

## Collaborative Project Setup

### Team Lead: Initialize Collaborative Project

The team lead creates the shared infrastructure using R functions:

```{r team-lead-setup}
library(zzcollab)

# Configure team settings (one-time setup)
init_config()
set_config("team_name", "datasci-lab")
set_config("github_account", "datasci-lab")
set_config("paradigm", "analysis")
set_config("build_mode", "comprehensive")

# Create team project with shared infrastructure
team_project <- init_team_project(
  project_name = "customer-churn-analysis",
  paradigm = "analysis",
  team_size = 4,
  github_integration = TRUE,
  auto_setup_ci = TRUE
)

# Set up team coordination features
setup_team_coordination(
  project = team_project,
  features = c("code_review", "automated_testing", "shared_documentation"),
  notification_channels = c("slack", "email")
)

# Display project information for team sharing
print(team_project)
```

**What this creates:**
- Shared Docker images with team-standard packages
- GitHub repository with team collaboration features
- CI/CD pipelines for automated validation
- Team communication and coordination tools
- Standardized project structure for all team members

### Team Members: Join Collaborative Project

Each team member joins using simple R functions:

```{r team-member-join}
library(zzcollab)

# Configure personal settings to match team
set_config("team_name", "datasci-lab")
set_config("paradigm", "analysis")

# Join existing team project (works for all team members)
my_role <- join_project(
  team_name = "datasci-lab",
  project_name = "customer-churn-analysis",
  role = "senior_developer",  # Options: team_lead, senior_developer, data_scientist, junior_developer
  development_focus = c("modeling", "visualization")  # Optional specialization
)

# Verify team environment setup
validate_team_environment()
print(my_role)
```

**What this provides:**
- Identical computational environment as team lead
- Role-appropriate development tools and permissions
- Access to shared data, functions, and documentation
- Integration with team workflow and communication systems

## Daily Team Development Workflow

### Starting Collaborative Work Sessions

```{r daily-workflow-start}
# Check team project status and updates
team_status <- check_team_status("customer-churn-analysis")
print(team_status)

# Start development session with team synchronization
dev_session <- start_team_session(
  sync_latest = TRUE,        # Pull latest team changes
  notify_team = TRUE,        # Notify team of your work session
  work_focus = "data_modeling"  # Optional: specify work area
)

# Access shared team environment (RStudio or R console)
start_rstudio()  # Opens RStudio at localhost:8787 with team environment

# Alternative: Start R console with team environment
# start_r_session()
```

### Collaborative Development Inside the Environment

Your development environment includes all team packages and shared resources:

```{r collaborative-development}
# All team packages automatically available
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(palmerpenguins)  # Team's example dataset

# Load team-developed functions (automatically synchronized)
devtools::load_all()

# Access shared team data (automatically synchronized)
customer_data <- load_team_data("customer_churn_processed.rds")

# Develop analysis using team standards
develop_churn_model <- function(data, method = "random_forest") {
  # Team-standard function development
  # Follows team coding standards and documentation requirements

  # Input validation using team utilities
  validate_team_data(data, required_vars = c("churn", "tenure", "monthly_charges"))

  # Use team modeling framework
  model_result <- fit_team_model(
    data = data,
    response = "churn",
    method = method,
    validation = "cv",  # Team standard: always use cross-validation
    seed = 42           # Team reproducibility standard
  )

  # Log results using team tracking system
  log_team_analysis(
    function_name = "develop_churn_model",
    data_used = "customer_churn_processed.rds",
    method = method,
    performance = model_result$cv_accuracy
  )

  return(model_result)
}

# Test function using team testing framework
test_result <- test_team_function(develop_churn_model, test_data = customer_data[1:100,])

# Document work for team review
document_team_contribution(
  function_name = "develop_churn_model",
