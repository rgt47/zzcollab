## Issue 1: Docker Not Running

**ERROR MESSAGE**:
```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon
Is the docker daemon running?
```

**CAUSE**: Docker Desktop not started

**SOLUTIONS**:
- **macOS**: Open Docker Desktop from Applications
- **Windows**: Start Docker Desktop from Start Menu
- **Linux**: `sudo systemctl start docker`

**VERIFY**:
```bash
docker ps
# Should show running containers or empty list (not error)
```

---

## Issue 2: Port Already in Use (localhost:8787)

**ERROR MESSAGE**:
```
Bind for 0.0.0.0:8787 failed: port is already allocated
```

**CAUSE**: Another RStudio container using port 8787

**SOLUTIONS**:

**Option 1**: Stop the other container
```bash
docker ps                    # Find container ID
docker stop <container-id>   # Stop it
make docker-rstudio          # Try again
```

**Option 2**: Find which project is using the port
```bash
docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Ports}}"
# Shows which project owns port 8787
cd /path/to/that/project
# Ctrl+C in that terminal
```

**Option 3**: Use different port (advanced)
```bash
# Edit Makefile, change 8787 to 8788
```

---

## Issue 3: Image Not Found

**ERROR MESSAGE**:
```
Unable to find image 'myteam/projectcore-rstudio:latest' locally
Error response from daemon: pull access denied
```

**CAUSE**: Team image not built or wrong team name

**SOLUTIONS**:

**For solo researchers**:
```bash
# Make sure you ran zzcollab in this project
zzcollab -p projectname
```

**For team members**:
```bash
# Team lead needs to build and push images first
# Or: Team image name doesn't match
# Check DESCRIPTION file for correct team name
```

**Rebuild image**:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
make docker-build
```

---

## Issue 4: Permission Denied

**ERROR MESSAGE**:
```
Permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
```

**CAUSE**: User not in docker group (Linux)

**SOLUTIONS**:

**Linux**:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

**macOS/Windows**:
```bash
# Usually not an issue
# Restart Docker Desktop
```

**File permission issues**:
```bash
# Check project directory ownership
ls -la
# Should be owned by you, not root
```

---

## Issue 5: My Changes Disappeared!

**CAUSE**: Worked outside `/home/analyst/project` directory

**EXPLANATION**:
- Only files in `/home/analyst/project` persist
- Files elsewhere in container are lost when container stops

**SOLUTIONS**:

**Prevention**:
- Always work in `/home/analyst/project`
- RStudio starts there automatically
- Don't cd to other directories

**Recovery** (if happened):
- Sorry, files outside mounted directory are lost
- Lesson learned: stay in `/project`!

**Verify you're in right place**:
```r
# In RStudio:
getwd()
# Should show: /home/analyst/project
```

## Issue 6: Package Installation Failed

**ERROR MESSAGE**:
```
Installation of package 'X' had non-zero exit status
```

**COMMON CAUSES & SOLUTIONS**:

### Cause: Missing system dependencies

**Solution**:
```r
# Some packages need system libraries
# Example: sf package needs GDAL, GEOS, PROJ

# Option 1: Use specialized Docker profile
# zzcollab --profile-name geospatial  # For sf, terra, raster

# Option 2: Ask team lead to add system libraries to Docker image

# Option 3: Use alternative package without system dependencies
```

### Cause: CRAN server down

**Solution**:
```r
# Try different mirror
install.packages("packagename",
                 repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```

### Cause: Package not on CRAN

**Solution**:
```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("user/package")
```

### Cause: Package requires newer R version

**Solution**:
```r
# Check package requirements
# May need to use older package version
remotes::install_version("packagename", version = "1.0.0")
```

## Issue 7: RStudio Won't Connect (localhost:8787)

**ERROR MESSAGE**:
```
This site can't be reached
localhost refused to connect
```

**DIAGNOSTIC STEPS**:

1. **Is container running?**
   - Terminal should show logs, not prompt
   - If you see `$` prompt, container stopped

2. **Is it RStudio container?**
   ```bash
   make docker-rstudio
   # NOT: make docker-zsh or make docker-r
   ```

3. **Check container status**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   # Should see container with port 0.0.0.0:8787->8787
   ```

4. **Try different browser**:
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Some browsers cache connection failures

5. **Check firewall**:
   - Firewall might block localhost
   - Try: `http://127.0.0.1:8787`

**SOLUTIONS**:

**Restart container**:
```bash
# Ctrl+C in terminal
make docker-rstudio
```

**Check port**:
```bash
lsof -i :8787  # macOS/Linux
# Shows what's using port 8787
```

---

## Issue 8: GitHub Authentication Failed

**ERROR MESSAGE**:
```
fatal: Authentication failed
gh: command not found
```

**CAUSE**: GitHub CLI not installed or not authenticated

**SOLUTIONS**:

**Install gh**:
```bash
macOS:   brew install gh
Linux:   sudo apt install gh
Windows: winget install GitHub.cli
```

**Authenticate**:
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow prompts, choose HTTPS
# Use web browser for easiest setup
```

**Verify**:
```bash
gh auth status
# Should show: ✓ Logged in to github.com
```

**Alternative** (no -G flag):
```bash
# Skip automatic GitHub repo creation
zzcollab -p project  # No -G flag
# Create repo manually later
```

---

## Issue 9: renv Problems

### ERROR: "renv is not installed"

**Solution**:
```r
install.packages("renv")
```

### ERROR: "renv.lock is out of sync"

**Solution**:
```r
renv::status()    # See what's wrong
renv::snapshot()  # Update lockfile
```

### ERROR: "Package versions don't match"

**Solution**:
```r
renv::restore()   # Restore from lockfile
```

### ERROR: "renv cache is corrupted"

**Solution**:
```r
# Delete cache, reinstall
renv::purge("packagename")
install.packages("packagename")
```

**Common workflow**:
```r
install.packages("newpackage")  # Install
renv::snapshot()                # Record
# Commit renv.lock to git
```

---

## Issue 10: Build Takes Too Long

**PROBLEM**: Docker build taking 15-20 minutes

**SOLUTIONS**:

**Use lighter Docker profile**:
```bash
zzcollab --config set profile-name "minimal"
# Minimal pre-installed packages
# Add more packages dynamically with renv::install()
```

**Or: Analysis profile** (recommended):
```bash
zzcollab --config set profile-name "analysis"
# Includes tidyverse and common analysis packages
# Install additional packages as needed with renv::install()
```

**Reuse team base image**:
```bash
# See: zzcollab --help-quickstart
# Create one comprehensive base image
# Reuse for all projects (~30 seconds each)
```

**Check Docker resources**:
```bash
# Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources
# Increase CPU/Memory allocation
```

---

## Additional Common Issues

### Issue: "make: command not found"

**Install make**:
```bash
macOS:   xcode-select --install
Linux:   sudo apt install build-essential
Windows: Use WSL2 or install make for Windows
```

### Issue: "Container exits immediately"

**Check logs**:
```bash
docker logs <container-name>
# Shows why container failed
```

**Common cause**: Syntax error in Dockerfile
```bash
# Check Dockerfile for typos
```

### Issue: "zzcollab: command not found"

**zzcollab not in PATH**:
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

# Or use full path:
~/bin/zzcollab
```

### Issue: "Different results on different computers"

This is the problem zzcollab solves!

**Likely cause**: Different package versions

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure renv.lock is committed
git add renv.lock
git commit -m "Lock package versions"

# On other computer:
git pull
make docker-rstudio
# In RStudio:
renv::restore()
```

## Diagnostic Commands

### Check Docker status

```bash
docker --version              # Docker installed?
docker ps                     # Running containers
docker images                 # Available images
docker system df              # Disk usage
```

### Check zzcollab project

```bash
ls -la                        # Project files present?
cat DESCRIPTION               # Check team/project name
cat renv.lock | head          # Package versions
```

### Check R environment

```r
# In R console:
.libPaths()                   # Where packages installed
installed.packages()[,1]      # What's installed
renv::status()                # renv state
```

### Network diagnostics

```bash
ping -c 3 cloud.r-project.org  # Can reach CRAN?
curl -I https://github.com     # GitHub accessible?
```
