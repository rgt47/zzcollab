This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively used but preserved for reference.

## Files in This Archive

### 1. MARWICK_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md
**Archived**: October 20, 2025
**Reason**: Historical comparison with Marwick et al. (2018) approach
**Value**: Provides context on how ZZCOLLAB evolved from established research compendium frameworks
**Status**: Comparison remains valid, but not actionable guidance for current users

### 2. RRTOOLS_COMPATIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md
**Archived**: October 20, 2025
**Reason**: Analyzes three-paradigm system (ZZCOLLAB transitioned to unified paradigm in October 2025)
**Value**: Documents structural evolution and compatibility analysis
**Status**: Updated with October 2025 context before archival
**Note**: Analysis remains valuable for understanding framework design decisions

### 3. FIX4_DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md

## Why Archive These Documents?

These documents were moved to archive as part of the October 2025 documentation audit to:
- **Reduce clutter** in main docs/ directory
- **Improve discoverability** of current, actionable documentation
- **Preserve historical record** of framework evolution and planning processes
- **Clarify documentation purpose** for new users and contributors

## Should I Reference These?

**Generally no**, unless you're:
- Researching ZZCOLLAB's design evolution
- Understanding framework compatibility decisions
- Studying the documentation migration planning process
- Working on academic publications about reproducible research frameworks

For current usage, see the main `docs/` directory and `docs/guides/` for actionable documentation.
