 > what is the set of commands for dev 1 if he wants to initiate a new analysis project for dev 2 and
   dev 3 to work on, , png1, without building a local workspace.

⏺ Based on the current zzcollab selective base image building system, here are the commands for
  Developer 1 (Team Lead) to initiate a new analysis project png1 for team collaboration without
  building a local workspace:

  Developer 1: Team Lead Setup (No Local Workspace)

  # 1. Navigate to projects directory
  cd ~/projects  # or your preferred projects directory

  # 2. Initialize team project with selective base image building
  # Choose one approach based on team needs:

  # Option A: Build only shell variant (fastest - recommended for command-line teams)
  zzcollab -i -t rgt47 -p png1 -B r-ver -S

  # Option B: Build only RStudio variant (for GUI-focused teams)
  zzcollab -i -t rgt47 -p png1 -B rstudio -S

  # Option C: Build only verse variant (for publishing-focused teams)
  zzcollab -i -t rgt47 -p png1 -B verse -S

  # Option D: Build all variants (traditional approach - takes longer)
  zzcollab -i -t rgt47 -p png1 -B all -S

  # Note: Omitting -d ~/dotfiles means no local workspace is built

  What This Does:

  1. Creates project directory: png1/
  2. Sets up team Docker images:
    - Builds and pushes to Docker Hub as rgt47/png1core-shell:latest (and/or other variants)
  3. Initializes zzcollab project structure: Complete R package with analysis framework
  4. Creates private GitHub repository: https://github.com/rgt47/png1
  5. Sets up automated CI/CD: GitHub Actions for team image management
  6. Enables team collaboration: Dev 2 and Dev 3 can join immediately

  For Dev 2 and Dev 3 to Join:

  # 1. Clone the project
  git clone https://github.com/rgt47/png1.git
  cd png1

  # 2. Join with available interface (they'll get helpful errors if variant unavailable)
  zzcollab -t rgt47 -p png1 -I shell -d ~/dotfiles      # If shell variant available
  zzcollab -t rgt47 -p png1 -I rstudio -d ~/dotfiles    # If RStudio variant available
  zzcollab -t rgt47 -p png1 -I verse -d ~/dotfiles      # If verse variant available

  # 3. Start development
  make docker-zsh        # or make docker-rstudio, make docker-verse

  Key Benefits of This Approach:

  - ✅ No local workspace for Dev 1: Team infrastructure created without personal development setup
  - ✅ Faster initialization: Only builds needed variants, not all three
  - ✅ Immediate team access: Dev 2 & 3 can join as soon as GitHub repo is created
  - ✅ Flexible team scaling: Can add more variants later with zzcollab -V rstudio
  - ✅ Error guidance: Team members get helpful messages if requesting unavailable variants

  If Team Needs Multiple Interfaces Later:

  Developer 1 can add variants incrementally:

  cd png1
  zzcollab -V rstudio    # Add RStudio variant
  zzcollab -V verse      # Add verse variant for publishing

  This approach optimizes for team coordination while minimizing setup overhead for the team lead!

> what does dev 2 do when finished development?

⏺ When Developer 2 finishes their development work, here's the complete workflow:

  Dev 2: Development Completion Workflow

  1. Final Testing & Validation (Inside Container)

  # Still in development container (make docker-zsh)
  R
  # Run final tests
  devtools::load_all()           # Load all package functions
  devtools::test()               # Run unit tests
  testthat::test_dir("tests/integration")  # Run integration tests
  source("scripts/my_analysis.R")  # Test your analysis script
  quit()

  2. Exit Container & Validate Dependencies

  # Exit the development container
  exit

  # Validate all dependencies are properly tracked
  make docker-check-renv-fix     # Auto-fix any dependency issues
  make docker-test               # Run all tests in clean environment
  make docker-render             # Ensure reports render correctly

  3. Git Workflow - Commit Changes

  # Check what you've changed
  git status
  git diff

  # Stage and commit your work
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add [feature description] with comprehensive tests

  - [Describe what you implemented]
  - [List any new packages added]
  - [Mention test coverage]
  - All tests passing and dependencies validated"

  # Push to your feature branch (if using feature branches - recommended)
  git push origin feature/my-analysis

  # OR push directly to main (if using simple workflow)
  git push origin main

  4. Create Pull Request (Recommended Team Workflow)

  # Create PR for team review
  gh pr create --title "Add [feature description]" \
      --body "## Summary
  - [Describe your contribution]
  - [List any new analysis scripts/functions]
  - [Mention if new packages were added]

  ## Testing
  - [x] All unit tests pass
  - [x] Integration tests pass
  - [x] Analysis scripts run without errors
  - [x] Report renders successfully
  - [x] Dependencies validated

  ## Impact
  - [Describe how this affects the project]
  - [Any breaking changes or requirements for other devs]"

  5. What Happens Next (Automated)

  When Dev 2 pushes changes:

  1. GitHub Actions automatically:
    - ✅ Runs R package validation
    - ✅ Executes all tests
    - ✅ Renders analysis reports
    - ✅ Detects if new packages were added
  2. If new packages detected:
    - ✅ Rebuilds team Docker image with new packages
    - ✅ Pushes updated image to Docker Hub (rgt47/png1core-*:latest)
    - ✅ Notifies team via commit comment with update instructions
  3. Team gets notification:
  🐳 Team Docker Image Updated

  New packages detected: tidymodels, plotly

  Team members: Update your environment with:
  git pull
  docker pull rgt47/png1core-shell:latest
  make docker-zsh

  6. Team Synchronization (Dev 1 & Dev 3)

  Other team members sync automatically:
  # Dev 1 and Dev 3 run when they see the notification:
  git pull                           # Get latest code changes
  docker pull rgt47/png1core-shell:latest  # Get updated team environment
  make docker-zsh                   # Continue development with new packages

  Alternative: Simple Direct Push Workflow

  If not using pull requests:
  # After validation (steps 1-2 above)
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add my analysis with tests - all dependencies validated"
  git push origin main              # Direct push triggers team image rebuild

  Key Benefits of This Workflow:

  - ✅ Zero manual image management: GitHub Actions handles Docker rebuilds
  - ✅ Automatic team notification: Everyone knows when environment updates
  - ✅ Dependency validation: Prevents environment drift before commit
  - ✅ Professional quality: Tests, validation, and documentation required
  - ✅ Team coordination: Clear communication about changes and impacts

  Dev 2's Work is Done! 🎉

  Once Dev 2 pushes their changes:
  - Code is integrated into the main project
  - Team environment is updated automatically
  - Other developers are notified and can sync
  - Dev 2 can start next feature or analysis

  This workflow ensures zero-friction collaboration while maintaining enterprise-grade quality
  standards! 🚀
