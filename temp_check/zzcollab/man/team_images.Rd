\title{List available zzcollab team Docker images}
\usage{
team_images()
}
\value{
Data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{repository}: Docker repository name (e.g., "myteam/projectcore")
\item \code{tag}: Image tag (e.g., "latest", "v1.0.0")
\item \code{size}: Image size (e.g., "2.5GB")
\item \code{created}: Creation timestamp
Returns empty data frame if no team images are found.
}
}
\description{
Retrieves information about team Docker images that have been created for
zzcollab projects. Team images are base images that contain pre-installed
packages and configurations shared across team members.
}
\details{
This function searches for Docker images with the 'zzcollab.team' label,
which is automatically applied to team base images created during project
initialization. Team images are typically named following the pattern:
teamname/projectnamecore-variant:tag

Team images serve as the foundation for individual development environments,
ensuring all team members work with identical package versions and system
configurations.

\dontrun{
# List all available team images

# Check for specific team's images
images <- team_images()
myteam_images <- images[grepl("myteam", images$repository), ]
print(myteam_images)
